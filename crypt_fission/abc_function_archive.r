## Input: crypt_fission_rate is a float and has the units fissions per crypt per year.
##        largest_distance is the largest distance seen for any two crypts for the biopsy being simulated
##        patient_age is the age of the patient from which the biopsy was taken.
## Output: A dataframe containing the whole history of the grid throughout the simulation. 
## Algorithm:
##            1. Define a grid with dimensions that are three times as large as the largest distance seen for the biopsy
##            2. Draw the time until next crypt fission from exponential distribution with expected value
##            crypt_fission_rate times the number of crypts that can undergo fission. 
##            3. Randomly choose a crypt from the grid to undergo fission and randomly choose one of it's neighbors
##            to die. 
##            4. Add two new lines to the dataframe, representing these new crypts. Update the death times of the original two

## Input: spat_rel_df is a spatial relationship matrix but one that exists as a dataframe object in R.
##        It should not have a header but it has an ID column which contains crypt IDs.
##        The matrix should contain 0s on the diagonal line, crypt distances in the upper triangle

## Input: spat_rel_mat is a numeric matrix of crypt distances - like the one produced by format_matrix()
##        get_order is a boolean parameter specifying if the user wants the function to return a character vector giving

##          Call this character vector crypt_order

## The purpose of this function is to sample crypts from a slice of the grid in such a way that
## it reflects Henry's sampling
## Input: slice is a dataframe with the same columns as grid. All the crypts in <slice> have the same x-coordinate.
##        spatial_rel_matrix is a spatial relationship matrix where the row numbers are the crypt IDs and the 
##        matrix contains integer values representing the one-dimensional distance between the crypts. 
##        Alternatively, spatial_rel_matrix can be left empty and the crypt_distances given as a numeric vector
##        of distances. You don't actually need the crypt_order vector for now... 
## Output: Returns a subset of slice that has the size nrow(spatial_rel_matrix)
## Note: Currently can't handle missing values in the spatial_rel_matrix
##        There are multiple instances in Henryâ€˜s data where there are several groups of crypts within the biopsy. 
##        We know the spatial relationship between crypts within a group but not between groups. 
##        We donâ€˜t know the relative positions or the orientation of the groups.

##        for internal nodes correspond to coalescence times.
